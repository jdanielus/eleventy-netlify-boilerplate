We stayed in Bucharest for less than 24 hours. Our apartment was in the old town; after arriving late we walked around the revelers and grabbed a slice of pizza. In the morning, with the streets cleared out we took in some more touristy things including a trip to a shared artist space, the modern art museum, and the palatial parliament building.
