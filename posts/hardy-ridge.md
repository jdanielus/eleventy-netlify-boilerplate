In the last couple weeks my running schedule has managed to become less regimented but infinitely more social. This longer run was around 9 miles with a fair amount of elevation front loaded in the first half.
After a streak of beautiful and warm weather, we were out on a drizzly and cold day that obscured some of the lauded views of the gorge.
I felt good with some very mild cramping in my left thigh just after we stopped at the top for a snack.
On the way down we ran into a very young couple pushing a baby stroller towards the summit. At that point they were about 2.5 miles from the car. They asked if anything was "up there." To which we mentioned that the weather only gets worse and there are no views.
